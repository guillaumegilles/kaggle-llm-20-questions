If you want to run a game just like the competition, you can just use the defaults.\n:::\n\n::: {#c57c6590 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\nimport kaggle_environments\n\nenv = kaggle_environments.make(\"llm_20_questions\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{#667479cb .cell .markdown}\nWhen you initialize the environment, it sets the keyword to be guessed. You can inspect or change this in kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword\n:::\n\n::: {#1343b9bf .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\nprint(\"The keyword for this session is: \")\nprint(kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword)\nprint(\" \")\nprint(\"Some keywords have a list of alternative guesses (alts) that are also accepted.\")\nprint(\"For this session, the list of alts is:\")\nprint(kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.alts)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe keyword for this session is: \nWine Decanter\n \nSome keywords have a list of alternative guesses (alts) that are also accepted.\nFor this session, the list of alts is:\n['Decanter']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{#2fb20a9b .cell .markdown}\n### Create a Simple Agent\n\nIf you just want to experiment, an agent can be as simple as a Python function. Your agent is a function with two inputs, obs and cfg, and it provides a text response as output.\n\nThe agent needs to be able to handle three turnTypes (\"ask\", \"guess\" and \"answer\"). The response for answer has to be \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nHere are four simple agents:\n:::\n\n::: {#675b5459 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\ndef simple_agent1(obs, cfg):\n    # if agent is guesser and turnType is \"ask\"\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\": response = \"Is it a duck?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\": response = \"duck\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\": response = \"no\"\n    return response\n\ndef simple_agent2(obs, cfg):\n    # if agent is guesser and turnType is \"ask\"\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\": response = \"Is it a bird?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\": response = \"bird\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\": response = \"no\"\n    return response\n\ndef simple_agent3(obs, cfg):\n    # if agent is guesser and turnType is \"ask\"\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\": response = \"Is it a pig?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\": response = \"pig\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\": response = \"no\"\n    return response\n\ndef simple_agent4(obs, cfg):\n    # if agent is guesser and turnType is \"ask\"\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\": response = \"Is it a cow?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\": response = \"cow\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\": response = \"no\"\n    return response\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
